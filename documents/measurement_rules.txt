What to take care of for measurements:
- Check & note connected ports with EEG-channels
- When tightening the cap -> pull the fabric, not the plastic (could break)
- Ground & Ref must have a good connection! Ground=Base-board white wire; Ref=upper board white wire
- Arms rest on lab instead of table (table might have inference)
- Room with less interference for measurement, equal settings
- EEG connection around the motor cortex area should be good (important area)
- Filtering in OpenBCI can be used or not (own choice) -> I didn't use it

Instructions EEG-cap & dongle:
- Plug in battery for power
- Turn switch to PC
- Plug in dongle in PC
- Device Manager set time of port to 1ms instead of 16
- OpenBCI - Set Cyton, 16Ch -> click on Autoconnect -> Session starts
- Change one of the right windows to Networking
	- Choose LSL 
	- Choose TimeSeries, press 'on'

Note: Transferring of packages to Python was not reliable in battery mode with my computer
      --> Only worked when connected to energy supply
